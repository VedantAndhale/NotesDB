- Story: adds meaning to the data and makes it interesting
- Goals: makes the data usable and useful

#### Design thinking process

- **Empathize**: Think about the emotions and needs of the target audience.
- **Define**: Understand the audience’s needs, problems, and insights.
- **Ideate**: Use your findings from the previous phases to begin to create data visualizations.
- **Prototype:** Start putting it all together. In this case, you can put your findings into a presentation or dashboard.
- **Test**: Check that your prototype is effective. In this case, you can show your visualizations to team members before the presentation.
