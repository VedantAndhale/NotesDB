SMART:

- Specifc: one thing at a time
- Measrueable: should be measureed in scale
- Action-oriented: Should help to take some action
- Time-bound: should have a time line

Things to avoid:

- Leading question: answer is part of question
- Closed-ended questions: short response or Y/N type
- Vague questions: not specific
