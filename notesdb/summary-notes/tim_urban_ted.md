Here are some of the key points from the talk:

* Procrastination is caused by a conflict between the rational decision maker and the instant gratification monkey,then the panic monster  comes in picture to make us act .
* The panic monster can sometimes force procrastinators to get things done, but it is not a reliable motivator.
* There are two types of procrastination: deadline-based and non-deadline-based.
* Non-deadline-based procrastination can lead to missed opportunities and long-term regret.
* Everyone procrastinates on something, and it is important to be aware of the instant gratification monkey.
